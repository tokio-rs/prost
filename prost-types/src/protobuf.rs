/// other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be
/// clearly documented together with its declaration in the API.  In
/// any case, the effect on the returned resource/resources is required
/// behavior for APIs.
///
/// # Field Masks in Update Operations
///
/// A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the
/// targeted resource are going to be updated. The API is required
/// to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask
/// and leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to
/// describe the updated values, the API ignores the values of all
/// fields not covered by the mask.
///
/// If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will
/// be appended to the existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that
/// a repeated field is only allowed in the last position of a `paths` string.
///
/// If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an
/// update operation, then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message
/// in the target resource.
///
/// For example, given the target message:
///
/// ```text
/// f {
///    b {
///      d: 1
///      x: 2
///    }
///    c: \[1\]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// And an update message:
///
/// ```text
/// f {
///    b {
///      d: 10
///    }
///    c: \[2\]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// then if the field mask is:
///
/// paths: \["f.b", "f.c"\]
///
/// then the result will be:
///
/// ```text
/// f {
///    b {
///      d: 10
///      x: 2
///    }
///    c: \[1, 2\]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for
/// repeated and message fields.
///
/// In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must
/// be in the mask and set to the default value in the provided resource.
/// Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a default
/// instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do
/// not provide a mask as described below.
///
/// If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to
/// all fields (as if a field mask of all fields has been specified).
/// Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean that
/// fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into
/// the request will be reset to their default. If this is unwanted
/// behavior, a specific service may require a client to always specify
/// a field mask, producing an error if not.
///
/// As with get operations, the location of the resource which
/// describes the updated values in the request message depends on the
/// operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is
/// required to be honored by the API.
///
/// ## Considerations for HTTP REST
///
/// The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must
/// be set to PATCH instead of PUT in order to satisfy HTTP semantics
/// (PUT must only be used for full updates).
///
/// # JSON Encoding of Field Masks
///
/// In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are
/// separated by a comma. Fields name in each path are converted
/// to/from lower-camel naming conventions.
///
/// As an example, consider the following message declarations:
///
/// ```text
/// message Profile {
///    User user = 1;
///    Photo photo = 2;
/// }
/// message User {
///    string display_name = 1;
///    string address = 2;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:
///
/// ```text
/// mask {
///    paths: "user.display_name"
///    paths: "photo"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:
///
/// ```text
/// {
///    mask: "user.displayName,photo"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Field Masks and Oneof Fields
///
/// Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the
/// following message:
///
/// ```text
/// message SampleMessage {
///    oneof test_oneof {
///      string name = 4;
///      SubMessage sub_message = 9;
///    }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The field mask can be:
///
/// ```text
/// mask {
///    paths: "name"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Or:
///
/// ```text
/// mask {
///    paths: "sub_message"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in
/// paths.
///
/// ## Field Mask Verification
///
/// The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the
/// request should verify the included field paths, and return an
/// `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.

/// ```text

/// gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
///
/// Timestamp timestamp;
/// timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec);
/// timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);
/// ```
///
/// Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.
///
/// ```text
/// FILETIME ft;
/// GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft);
/// UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;
///
/// // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z
/// // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
/// Timestamp timestamp;
/// timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL));
/// timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));
/// ```
///
/// Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
///
/// ```text
/// long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
///
/// Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000)
///      .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();
/// ```
///
/// Example 5: Compute Timestamp from Java `Instant.now()`.
///

/// Instant now = Instant.now();
///
/// Timestamp timestamp =
///      Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(now.getEpochSecond())
///          .setNanos(now.getNano()).build();
/// ```
///
/// Example 6: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.
///
/// ```text
/// timestamp = Timestamp()
/// timestamp.GetCurrentTime()
/// ```
///
/// # JSON Mapping
///
/// In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the
/// [RFC 3339](<https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt>) format. That is, the
/// format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}\[.{frac_sec}\]Z"
/// where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},
/// {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional
/// seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),
/// are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone
/// is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by
/// "Z") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be
/// able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).
///
/// For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past
/// 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.
///
/// In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the
/// standard
/// [toISOString()](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString>)
/// method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted
/// to this format using
/// [`strftime`](<https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime>) with
/// the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use
/// the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`](<http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime(>)) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.
