/// `HttpRule` defines the mapping of an RPC method to one or more HTTP

/// `google.api.http` annotation on the RPC method,
/// see "google/api/annotations.proto" for details.
///
/// The mapping consists of a field specifying the path template and
/// method kind.  The path template can refer to fields in the request
/// message, as in the example below which describes a REST GET
/// operation on a resource collection of messages:
///
/// ```text
/// service Messaging {
///    rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
///      option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}";
///    }
/// }
/// message GetMessageRequest {
///    message SubMessage {
///      string subfield = 1;
///    }
///    string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
///    SubMessage sub = 2;    // `sub.subfield` is url-mapped
/// }
/// message Message {
///    string text = 1; // content of the resource
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The same http annotation can alternatively be expressed inside the
/// `GRPC API Configuration` YAML file.
///
/// ```text
/// http:
///    rules:
///      - selector: <proto_package_name>.Messaging.GetMessage
///        get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}
/// ```
///
/// This definition enables an automatic, bidrectional mapping of HTTP
/// JSON to RPC. Example:
///
/// |HTTP|RPC|
/// |----|---|
/// |`GET /v1/messages/123456/foo`|`GetMessage(message_id: "123456" sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`|
///
/// In general, not only fields but also field paths can be referenced
/// from a path pattern. Fields mapped to the path pattern cannot be
/// repeated and must have a primitive (non-message) type.
///
/// Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path
/// pattern automatically become (optional) HTTP query
/// parameters. Assume the following definition of the request message:
///
/// ```text
/// service Messaging {
///    rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
///      option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/messages/{message_id}";
///    }
/// }
/// message GetMessageRequest {
///    message SubMessage {
///      string subfield = 1;
///    }
///    string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
///    int64 revision = 2;    // becomes a parameter
///    SubMessage sub = 3;    // `sub.subfield` becomes a parameter
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:
///
/// |HTTP|RPC|
/// |----|---|
/// |`GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo`|`GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`|
///
/// Note that fields which are mapped to HTTP parameters must have a
/// primitive type or a repeated primitive type. Message types are not
/// allowed. In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be
/// repeated in the URL, as in `...?param=A&param=B`.
///
/// For HTTP method kinds which allow a request body, the `body` field
/// specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
/// message resource collection:
///
/// ```text
/// service Messaging {
///    rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
///      option (google.api.http) = {
///        put: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
///        body: "message"
///      };
///    }
/// }
/// message UpdateMessageRequest {
///    string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
///    Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
/// representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
/// protos JSON encoding:
///
/// |HTTP|RPC|
/// |----|---|
/// |`PUT /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }`|`UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`|
///
/// The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
/// every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
/// request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
/// the update method:
///
/// ```text
/// service Messaging {
///    rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
///      option (google.api.http) = {
///        put: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
///        body: "*"
///      };
///    }
/// }
/// message Message {
///    string message_id = 1;
///    string text = 2;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:
///
/// |HTTP|RPC|
/// |----|---|
/// |`PUT /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }`|`UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")`|
///
/// Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
/// have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
/// the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice of
/// defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
/// which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.
///
/// It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
/// the `additional_bindings` option. Example:
///
/// ```text
/// service Messaging {
///    rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
///      option (google.api.http) = {
///        get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
///        additional_bindings {
///          get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
///        }
///      };
///    }
/// }
/// message GetMessageRequest {
///    string message_id = 1;
///    string user_id = 2;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC
/// mappings:
///
/// |HTTP|RPC|
/// |----|---|
/// |`GET /v1/messages/123456`|`GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`|
/// |`GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456`|`GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id: "123456")`|
///
/// # Rules for HTTP mapping
///
/// The rules for mapping HTTP path, query parameters, and body fields
/// to the request message are as follows:
///
/// 1. The `body` field specifies either `*` or a field path, or is
///    omitted. If omitted, it indicates there is no HTTP request body.
/// 1. Leaf fields (recursive expansion of nested messages in the
///    request) can be classified into three types:
///    (a) Matched in the URL template.
///    (b) Covered by body (if body is `*`, everything except (a) fields;
///    else everything under the body field)
///    (c) All other fields.
/// 1. URL query parameters found in the HTTP request are mapped to (c) fields.
/// 1. Any body sent with an HTTP request can contain only (b) fields.
///
/// The syntax of the path template is as follows:
///
/// ```text
/// Template = "/" Segments \[ Verb \] ;
/// Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
/// Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
/// Variable = "{" FieldPath \[ "=" Segments \] "}" ;
/// FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
/// Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;
/// ```
///
/// The syntax `*` matches a single path segment. The syntax `**` matches zero
/// or more path segments, which must be the last part of the path except the
/// `Verb`. The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the path.
///
/// The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its
/// template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable
/// matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
/// is equivalent to `{var=*}`.
///
/// If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `"{var}"` or
/// `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path, all characters
/// except `\[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z\]` are percent-encoded. Such variables show up in the
/// Discovery Document as `{var}`.
///
/// If a variable contains one or more path segments, such as `"{var=foo/*}"`
/// or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path, all
/// characters except `\[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z\]` are percent-encoded. Such variables
/// show up in the Discovery Document as `{+var}`.
///
/// NOTE: While the single segment variable matches the semantics of
/// [RFC 6570](<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570>) Section 3.2.2
/// Simple String Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** match
/// RFC 6570 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion
/// does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead
/// to invalid URLs.
///
/// NOTE: the field paths in variables and in the `body` must not refer to
/// repeated fields or map fields.
